Description
===========
The extract_1d step extracts a 1-d signal from a 2-d or 3-d dataset and
writes a spectrum to a product.  This works on fixed-slit data (NIRSpec
data through any one or more of the fixed slits, MIRI LRS data through
the slit or in the slitless region, and NIRISS slitless data) as well as
IFU data and NIRSpec MOS (micro-shutter array) data.

For GRISM data (NIS_WFSS or NRC_WFSS), no reference file is used.
The extraction region is taken to be the full size of the input subarray
or cutout, or it could be restricted to the region within which the
world coordinate system is defined.  The dispersion direction is the one
along which the wavelengths change more rapidly.

For IFU data, the extraction options differ depending on
whether the target is a point source or an extended source.  For a point
source, the spectrum will be extracted using circular aperture photometry,
optionally including background subtraction using a circular annulus.
For an extended source, rectangular aperture photometry will be used, with
the entire image being extracted, and no background subtraction, regardless
of what was specified in the reference file or command-line arguments.
For either point source or extended, the photometry makes use of
astropy photutils.
The region of overlap between an aperture and a pixel can be calculated by
one of three different methods:  "exact", limited only by finite precision
arithmetic; "center", i.e. the full value in a pixel will be included if its
center is within the aperture; or "subsample", which means pixels will be
subsampled N x N, and the "center" option will be used for each sub-pixel.


Input
=====
Level 2-b countrate data, or level-3 data.  The format should be a
CubeModel, a SlitModel, an IFUCubeModel, an ImageModel, a DrizProductModel,
a MultiSlitModel, a MultiProductModel, or a ModelContainer.
The SCI extensions should
have keyword SLTNAME to specify which slit was extracted, though if there
is only one slit (e.g. full-frame data), the slit name can be taken from
the JSON reference file instead.

The input data should be in units of surface brightness, megajanskys per
steradian.  The photom step reads data in units of count rate and writes
data in units of surface brightness.

Output
======
The output will be in MultiSpecModel format; for each input slit there will
be an output table extension with the name EXTRACT1D.  This extension will
have columns WAVELENGTH, FLUX, ERROR, SURF_BRIGHT, SB_ERROR, DQ,
BACKGROUND, BERROR and NPIXELS.

Some metadata will be written to the table header, including the dispersion
direction (1 = horizontal, 2 = vertical) in the input 2-D or 3-D image.

WAVELENGTH was copied from the wavelength attribute of the input 2-D data,
if that attribute exists and was populated, or it was calculated from the
WCS otherwise.
FLUX is the flux density in janskys (or mJy for IFU data); see keyword
TUNIT2, if the data are in a FITS BINTABLE.  ERROR is the error estimate
for FLUX, and it has the same units as FLUX.
SURF_BRIGHT is the surface brightness in MJy / sr.  SB_ERROR is the error
estimate for SURF_BRIGHT.
While it was expected that a user would make use of the FLUX column for
point-source data or the SURF_BRIGHT column for an extended source,
both columns will be populated regardless of the target.
The extract_1d step collapses the input data from 2-D to 1-D by summing
one or more rows (or columns, depending on the dispersion direction).
A background may optionally be subtracted by the extract_1d step, but
there are also other options for background subtraction prior to extract_1d.
Since the input data are in units of MJy / sr, the SURF_BRIGHT column will be
populated by dividing the sum by the number of pixels (see the NPIXELS column,
described below) that were added together.  The FLUX column will be populated
by multiplying the sum by the solid angle of a pixel, and then multiplying
by 10^6 to convert from MJy to Jy.

NPIXELS is the number of pixels that were added together for the source
extraction region.  Note that this is not necessarily a constant, and
the value is not necessarily an integer (the data type is float).
BACKGROUND is the measured background, scaled to the extraction width used
for FLUX and SURF_BRIGHT.  BACKGROUND will be zero if no background was
subtracted in the extract_1d step.
ERROR, SB_ERROR, BERROR, and DQ are not populated with useful values yet.
